// - (void)setAuthorizeButton:(UIButton *);
// ...but a more semantically cohesive declaration. There are
// other benefits, like the ability to @synthesize properties,
// and some memory-management assistance.
// see http://www.google.com/search?q=objective+c+properties
// for more details.
// IBOutlet is a keyword 
// that's removed by the preprocessor (never compiled)
// and is used to tell Interface Builder that it can
// assign objects to them.

// Class methods, the "-"-sign denotes a instance method
// the "+"-sign would be used for class methods. IBAction
// is just a alias for void, but it works just like IBOutlet
// and lets Interface Builder know that it can set the method
// as a target for actions.
